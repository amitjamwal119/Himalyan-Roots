## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure Overview

### Folder Explanation

- **`app`** ‚Üí Contains all page components and logic. Each page has its own route, and reusable components are imported into parent components.
- **`redux-toolkit`** ‚Üí Contains the Redux setup for managing global state and async API logic using `createAsyncThunk`.
- **`types`** ‚Üí Stores TypeScript interfaces for maintaining strict type safety.
- **`public`** ‚Üí Holds assets like images, typography files, and icons used across the app.

```bash
cd json-server
npx json-server db.json --port 5000

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Frontend (Next.js UI)

In another terminal, run:

npm run dev


Your app will start at http://localhost:3000
